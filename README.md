# LibraryManagementSystem
This system allows for basic library operations such as adding books and students, borrowing books, returning books, and displaying the current status of books and students.
The book.txt file is editable; you can add the books you like. Similarly, the student.txt file allows you to add students for performing operations. The perform solution lets users choose to print the output either to a file or on the screen, with or without the details of books.
Always perform the 1st and 4th solutions before any other solutions because the first and fourth solutions are for importing the student list and the book list, respectively."
